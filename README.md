**Project Title: Yellow Rust Disease Classification using Deep Learning**

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing an automated image classification system for detecting Yellow Rust disease in wheat leaves. The system employs deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into different disease categories.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a deep learning model for classifying Yellow Rust disease from leaf images.
- Utilize image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.


### **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Images are resized to (256, 256) pixels.
   - Normalization is applied to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.
   - Image augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping are used.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Convolutional Layers:** Feature extraction using multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation.
   - **Pooling Layers:** MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
